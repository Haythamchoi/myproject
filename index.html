          <p>I have written this code in order to create my
          own research website related to <strong>"how does media represent Korea(n) in Japan?"</strong>. I will be introducing some intuitive information and fact
         which I have academically obtained from the academic sources. My main theme of this project will be focused on the media's reaction towards the missile test by North Korea
         which I have no doubt that the missile launch from North Korea would have worsened the image of Korea(n) drastically.
         Moreover, have Koreans ever been discriminated in Japan? like how?. The reason why I have chosen this topic is to acknowledge the importance of knowing the current social status of Koreans in Japan which I have to be aware of.
         All the adademic resources will be carefully and precisely quoted with a clear reference at the bottom.</p>

          <p>This article was written based on how Japanese people showed their negative reactions toward the missile launch from North Korea.
          People were terrified and showed their strong anxiety after they recieved the warning message. Obviosuly the image of Koreans in Japan will significantly fall.
       Ironically, Hokkaido residents pointed out that the residents could not find adequate place to evacuate as soon as they received a message to evacuate.</p>

          <p>This article was written based on the direct analysis and view of Japan towards North Korea's threat.
          The missile provocation of North Korea has been illustrated as the biggest threat so far. For instance,
        according to Suzuki (2018), <strong>"North Korea represents the greatest threat to Japan by far"</strong>.
      Moreover, there is a possibility that the missile can bring a catastrophical consequence once there is a miscalculation of the orbit or malfunction of the missile.
      Japanese people will end up suffering due to psychological damage of trauma. According to Suzuki (2018), <strong>"The risk that one may strike a Japanese city, even if due to malfunctioning or miscalculation, would prove disastrous. Such fears have a strong psychological
       impact on people in Japan"</strong>.
