          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>I have written this code in order to create my
          own research website related to <strong>"how does media represent Korea(n) in Japan?"</strong>. I will be introducing some intuitive information and fact
         which I have academically obtained from the academic sources. My main theme of this project will be focused on the media's reaction towards the missile test by North Korea
         which I have no doubt that the missile launch from North Korea would have worsened the image of Korea(n) drastically.
         Moreover, have Koreans ever been discriminated in Japan? like how?. The reason why I have chosen this topic is to acknowledge the importance of knowing the current social status of Koreans in Japan which I have to be aware of.
         All the adademic resources will be carefully and precisely quoted with a clear reference at the bottom of this webpage.</p>

          <p>This article was written based on how Japanese people showed their negative reactions toward the missile launch from North Korea.
          People were terrified and showed their strong anxiety after they recieved the warning message. Obviosuly the image of Koreans in Japan will significantly fall.
       Ironically, Hokkaido residents pointed out that the residents could not find adequate place to evacuate as soon as they received a message to evacuate.</p>

          <p>This article was written based on the direct analysis and view of Japan towards North Korea's threat.
          The missile provocation of North Korea has been illustrated as the biggest threat so far. For instance,
        according to Suzuki (2018), <strong>"North Korea represents the greatest threat to Japan by far"</strong>.
      Moreover, there is a possibility that the missile can bring a catastrophical consequence once there is a miscalculation of the orbit or malfunction of the missile.
      Japanese people will end up suffering due to psychological damage of trauma. According to Suzuki (2018), <strong>"The risk that one may strike a Japanese city, even if due to malfunctioning or miscalculation, would prove disastrous. Such fears have a strong psychological
       impact on people in Japan"</strong>.

          <p>This is an article which demonstrates one Zainichi boy who was emphasizing himself as a Korean
      as well as how he had to behave diffrently in the Japanese society. It is the reality that the image of Korea(n)
    has been known full of bad reputation in Japan. For instance, it was a conversation between the author and the boy
    , according to Ambrose (2018), <strong>"I said, this is my name and I am Korean. 'My friend said, Oh, my mother and father
      told me that is the country where bad people live'"</strong>. The most important fact is that
    Zainichi people have been discriminated by Japanese society and they are accustomed to that discrimination. For example,
  according to Ambrose (2018), <strong>"this kind of discrimination is a common experience for Zainichi"</strong>.</p>

          <br>
          <p>In this article, a life living as Zainichi in Japan has been well demonstrated. For instance, a lady Chung
          was born in Japan and she is fluent in speaking Japanese just like other typical japanese people. However, she was
        not considered as an actual Japanese citizenbut rather she was considered as a foreigner. Although Japanese society
      changed its attitude towards Zainichi and due to this fact, many Zainichi took Japanese names and became a citizen. However, not everyone.
    According to Onishi (2005), <strong>"Japan has softened its attitudes toward the Zainichi, and many have become citizens and taken Japanese names
  . Others have taken citizenship, but kept their Korean names. Others, like Chung, have taken neither citizenship nor name"</strong>.</p>

          <br>
          <p>This academic article written by Arvydas Kumpis "representations of Zainichi Koreans in Japanese media" is focused on the study of living as a Korean in Japan.
          While the reading was being analyzed, I discovered the fact that surprisingly, Koreans have been considered uneducated and lower class in the Japanese society
        and this is because the number of Koreans were too few that they were not enough to perform a crucial role in the Japanese society. According to Kumpis (2015),
      <strong>"Some statistics unveil that only about 10% of Koreans were in Tokyo for educational purposes in that time (Lie 2008, p. 6). The proportion was outweighed by farmers (Lie 2008, 0. 4-5)
        This allowed Japanese majority to perceive Koreans as lower class and uneducated people"</strong>. It seems like that Koreans were highly discriminated based on the historical fact.
      Moreover, it is such an unfortunate to read one paragraph that there was Korean massacre after the Great Kanto earthquake occured in 1923. A small rumour caused a great consequence killing a thousand of innocent Koreans in the street.
    It is a tragedy which has to be devotionally remembered and should not be repeated again. According to Kumpis (2015), <strong>"Rumour encouraged a rage of local Japanese and their attacks resulted in killng of several thousand Koreans simply in the streets.
      All in all, the image of ethnic Koreans in Japan was negative from the very beginning"</strong>.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>As a conclusion, I have carefully examined and explained <strong>'how does media represent Korea(n) in Japan</strong> with a sufficient amount of academical information.
          Moreover, I have concluded that Japanese society and the media have a negative awareness of Koreans in general since past until now. Due to this fact, in overall, I would not expect this phenomenon to be resolved peacefully and politically.
        However, it is our responsibility to end this histrocal dispute immediately While Korea and Japan must find an effective solution in order to be prospered in terms of economy and build a strong relationship.
        Therefore, the terminology 'cooperation and understadning' are crucial in order to be fulfilled. I will be looking forward to seeing such miracle to be succeeded. It is just a small hope.</p>
